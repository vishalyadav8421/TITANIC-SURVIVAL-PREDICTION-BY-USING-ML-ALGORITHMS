# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and contains information about Titanic passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features available in the dataset. By doing so, we aim to gain insights into the factors that played a significant role in determining survival rates during the Titanic disaster.

## Methodology

1. *Data Exploration*: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and distribution of features.

2. *Data Preprocessing*: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling as necessary to prepare the data for modeling.

3. *Feature Engineering*: Create new features or transform existing ones to extract valuable information that can improve the performance of the predictive model.

4. *Model Selection*: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to identify the best-performing model.

5. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset.

6. *Hyperparameter Tuning*: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model(s) using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize performance.

7. *Model Interpretation*: Interpret the trained model to understand the importance of different features in predicting survival outcomes.
